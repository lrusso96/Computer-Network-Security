# Homework 6

### Goal
Design suitable exchange of messages allowing a fair match between two opponents.

In particular it should:

- enforce data integrity
- prevent players from obtaining unfair advantage from pre-computation
- contrast replay attacks

Moreover it is allowed to use (but not all of them!) nonces, timestamps, hash functions, symmetric encryption / decryption, public key cryptography, and so on. The protocol should be also as simple as possible, providing the same guarantees the analogical players have.
